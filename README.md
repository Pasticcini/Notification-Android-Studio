# Notification-Android-Studio
With this code you can easily use daily notifications in Android Studio
This code is written to show the notification once a day.
If you try several times in the same day with the same device, the notification will appear only on the first attempt.
If you want to do some tests, 
I recommend to use different devices or correcting the code to show it at desired intervals. 
Thanks and let me know if you have any problems
